## ⚡ Quick Smoke Test (5 minutes)

If you're short on time, run this abbreviated test:

1. **Filter Preservation**: Apply 3 filters → like newsletter → verify URL unchanged
2. **Unarchive**: Go to archived view → unarchive → verify disappears + correct message
3. **Count Accuracy**: Check source page total vs Inbox filtered count
4. **Order Stability**: Note newsletter order → perform 3 actions → verify same order
5. **Cross-Page**: Action on Inbox → check Newsletter Sources → verify consistency

**All 5 should pass for successful implementation.**
