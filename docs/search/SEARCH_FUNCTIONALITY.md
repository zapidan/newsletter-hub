## Technical Implementation

### API Integration
The search functionality uses the `searchNewsletters` API function which:
- Searches across `title`, `content`, and `summary` fields
- Supports pagination with configurable limits
- Includes related data (sources, tags)
- Handles filtering server-side for performance

### Search Parameters
```typescript
interface SearchParams {
  search: string;           // Search query
  limit: number;           // Results per page (default: 20)
  offset: number;          // Pagination offset
  sourceIds?: string[];    // Filter by source IDs
  isRead?: boolean;        // Filter by read status
  isArchived?: boolean;    // Filter by archive status
  dateFrom?: string;       // Start date filter
  dateTo?: string;         // End date filter
  includeSource: boolean;  // Include source data
  includeTags: boolean;    // Include tag data
}
```

### Search Highlighting
- Uses custom `highlightSearchTerms` function
- Highlights individual search terms in results
- Applies to titles, summaries, and content snippets
- Uses yellow background with rounded corners

### Local Storage
- Recent searches are stored in `newsletter_recent_searches`
- Maintains up to 10 recent searches
- Automatically deduplicates search history

## Components and Files

### Main Files
- `src/web/pages/Search.tsx` - Main search component
- `src/common/api/newsletterApi.ts` - API functions
- `src/web/index.css` - Search-specific styles

### Key Functions
- `searchNewsletters()` - API call for searching
- `highlightSearchTerms()` - Text highlighting utility
- `getSearchContext()` - Content snippet extraction
- `handleSearch()` - Main search handler
- `performSearch()` - API integration function

### CSS Classes
- `.line-clamp-2` - Text truncation utility
- `mark` - Search term highlighting styles
- Custom scrollbar styles for suggestions dropdown

## Search Query Examples

### Basic Searches
- `AI` - Find newsletters about artificial intelligence
- `crypto market` - Find content about cryptocurrency markets
- `startup funding` - Find newsletters about startup investment

### Advanced Usage
- Use filters to narrow by specific sources
- Set date ranges to find recent content
- Combine read/unread filters with topics
- Search within archived newsletters

## Performance Considerations

- **Server-side search**: All searching happens on the database level
- **Pagination**: Large result sets are paginated for performance
- **Debounced suggestions**: Suggestions are generated locally to avoid API calls
- **Efficient highlighting**: Text highlighting is done client-side only on visible results

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the search functionality:
- Full-text search with ranking
- Saved search queries
- Search within specific time periods
- Export search results
- Advanced boolean search operators
- Search result sorting options
- Search analytics and insights
