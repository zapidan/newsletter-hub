# Test Workflow YAML Fixes

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Package Manager Inconsistency

**Problem**: Mixed usage of `npm` and `pnpm` commands
```yaml
# ❌ Before (inconsistent)
run: |
  npm run test:results:parse
  npm run test:coverage:parse
  npm run test:dashboard
```

**Solution**: Consistent use of `pnpm` throughout
```yaml
# ✅ After (consistent)
run: |
  pnpm run test:results:parse
  pnpm run test:coverage:parse
  pnpm run test:dashboard
```

### 2. YAML Structure Issues

**Problem**: The workflow had proper YAML structure but needed consistency improvements

**Solution**: 
- Ensured consistent indentation
- Fixed package manager usage
- Maintained proper YAML syntax

### 3. GitHub Script Comment Formatting

**Problem**: Backticks in the comment string needed proper escaping

**Solution**: Used proper escaping for backticks in the comment:
```javascript
// ✅ Properly escaped backticks
- Test Results: \`test-results/\`
- Coverage Reports: \`html/\`
- Dashboard: \`test-dashboard/\`
```

## Current Workflow Structure

The test workflow now has the following structure:

1. **Changes Detection Job**: Determines what files changed
2. **Lint and Type Check Job**: Runs linting and type checking
3. **Test Job**: Runs tests and generates reports

### Test Job Steps:

1. **Setup**: Checkout, install pnpm, setup Node.js, install dependencies
2. **Debug**: Show vitest setup information
3. **Install Playwright**: Install browser dependencies
4. **Create Directories**: Ensure test results directory exists
5. **Run Tests**: Execute tests with coverage
6. **Generate Dashboard**: Create test results, coverage, and dashboard reports
7. **Comment PR**: Add dashboard links to pull requests
8. **Display Summary**: Show coverage summary
9. **Verify Execution**: Debug test execution
10. **List Results**: Show test results directory contents
11. **Check XML Files**: Verify XML files exist
12. **Create Fallback**: Create fallback test result if none exist
13. **Upload Results**: Upload to test reporter
14. **Upload Artifacts**: Upload all test artifacts

## Validation

The workflow has been validated for:
- ✅ Proper YAML syntax
- ✅ Consistent package manager usage
- ✅ Correct indentation
- ✅ Proper escaping of special characters
- ✅ Valid GitHub Actions syntax

## Usage

The workflow will run automatically on:
- Push to any branch
- Pull requests to main/develop
- Daily at 2 AM UTC (scheduled)

## Output

The workflow generates:
- Test results in `test-results/`
- Coverage reports in `html/`
- Dashboard in `test-dashboard/`
- PR comments with dashboard links
- Uploaded artifacts for download

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter YAML parsing errors:

1. **Check Indentation**: Ensure consistent 2-space indentation
2. **Validate Syntax**: Use a YAML validator
3. **Check Special Characters**: Ensure proper escaping
4. **Verify Package Manager**: Use consistent package manager commands

## Next Steps

The workflow is now ready for use. You can:
1. Push changes to trigger the workflow
2. Check the Actions tab for execution status
3. View generated reports and dashboard
4. Download artifacts for local review
