# E2E Test Setup Status

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed
1. **Integration Tests**
   - All 35 integration tests passing
   - Fixed mock implementations for all dependencies
   - Created focused test suites for queue and archive functionality

2. **Environment Setup**
   - Fixed Logger to handle test environments without `import.meta.env`
   - Created example environment configuration (`.env.test.example`)
   - Set up proper test environment loading in Playwright config

3. **Test Fixtures**
   - Created mock-compatible auth fixtures (`tests/e2e/fixtures/auth.ts`)
   - Created mock-compatible newsletter fixtures (`tests/e2e/fixtures/newsletter.ts`)
   - Fixed import paths in E2E tests to use local fixtures

### ðŸš§ In Progress
1. **Playwright Browser Installation**
   - Need to install Playwright browsers before running E2E tests
   - Command: `npx playwright install chromium`

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Basic `.env.test` file created from example
   - May need to update with actual test values

## Next Steps

### 1. Install Playwright Browsers
```bash
# Install all browsers
npx playwright install

# Or install only Chromium
npx playwright install chromium
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Update `.env.test` with appropriate values:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:54321
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-test-anon-key
VITE_USE_MOCK_API=true
NODE_ENV=test
```

### 3. Run E2E Tests
```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run specific test file
npm run test:e2e -- queue-archive.spec.ts

# Run in headed mode (see browser)
npm run test:e2e -- --headed

# Run with debugging
npm run test:e2e -- --debug
```

## Known Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Missing Playwright Browsers
**Error:** `Executable doesn't exist at .../chromium_headless_shell-1179/chrome-mac/headless_shell`

**Solution:** Run `npx playwright install`

### Issue 2: Environment Variables Not Loaded
**Error:** `supabaseUrl is required`

**Solution:** 
- Ensure `.env.test` exists with required variables
- Check that Playwright config is loading the env file correctly

### Issue 3: Mock API vs Real API Confusion
**Current Setup:** E2E tests are configured to use mock APIs (`VITE_USE_MOCK_API=true`)

**Considerations:**
- Mock fixtures return predefined data
- No actual database operations occur
- Good for testing UI interactions without backend dependencies

## Test Structure

```
tests/e2e/
â”œâ”€â”€ fixtures/           # Mock-compatible test data generators
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth.ts        # Authentication helpers
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ newsletter.ts  # Newsletter data helpers
â”œâ”€â”€ newsletter/        # Newsletter-related tests
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ queue-archive.spec.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ setup/            # Test environment setup
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test-environment.ts
â””â”€â”€ helpers/          # Shared test utilities
    â””â”€â”€ toast.ts      # Toast notification helpers
```

## E2E Test Coverage

The `queue-archive.spec.ts` test file covers:

1. **Queue Removal Persistence**
   - Remove from queue and verify persistence
   - Handle operations from list view
   - Show items in reading queue view

2. **Auto-Archive Functionality**
   - Auto-archive when marking as read (with setting enabled)
   - No auto-archive when setting is disabled
   - Manual archive operations

3. **Combined Operations**
   - Queue and archive operations together

4. **Error Handling**
   - Network error simulation
   - Recovery from failed operations

## Recommendations

1. **Complete Browser Installation**
   - Install Playwright browsers immediately
   - Consider adding to project setup documentation

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Document required environment variables
   - Consider creating different env files for different test scenarios

3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Add E2E tests to CI pipeline after local validation
   - Cache Playwright browsers in CI to speed up runs

4. **Test Data Management**
   - Current setup uses mock data
   - Consider implementing test database seeding for more realistic tests

5. **Monitoring**
   - Set up test result reporting
   - Track test execution time and flakiness

## Summary

The E2E test infrastructure is nearly complete. The main remaining task is installing Playwright browsers. Once installed, the tests should run successfully with the mock API setup. The test structure provides good coverage of the queue removal and auto-archive functionality, matching the requirements from the integration tests.
