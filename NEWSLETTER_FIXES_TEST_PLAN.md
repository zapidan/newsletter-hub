# Newsletter Filtering Fixes - Comprehensive Test Plan

## Overview

This test plan validates the fixes implemented for newsletter filtering and action button issues in the Newsletter Hub application. All tests should be performed in a clean browser session with developer tools open to monitor console logs and network activity.

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
1. Clean browser cache and localStorage
2. Developer tools open (Console, Network tabs)
3. Test user account with sufficient newsletter data:
   - At least 20 newsletters across multiple sources
   - Mix of read/unread, liked/unliked, archived/unarchived
   - Various tags applied to newsletters
   - Some newsletters in reading queue

### Test Data Requirements
- **Sources**: At least 3 different newsletter sources
- **Newsletter States**: Mix of all combinations (read/unread, liked/unliked, archived/unarchived)
- **Tags**: At least 5 different tags applied to various newsletters
- **Reading Queue**: 5-10 newsletters in queue

## Test Cases
