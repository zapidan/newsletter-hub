# Newsletter Hub - Fixes Completed ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Multi-Tag Filtering Not Working
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Problem**: 
- URL was updating with multiple tags (e.g., `?tags=tag1,tag2`) but no filtering occurred
- Selected tags were not displayed in the UI
- Multi-tag filtering was using OR logic instead of AND logic

**Solution Applied**:
- Fixed API filtering logic to use AND logic (newsletters must have ALL specified tags)
- Enhanced tag loading validation in `useInboxFilters` hook
- Improved error handling for tag loading failures

**Files Changed**:
- `src/common/api/newsletterApi.ts` - Fixed filtering logic
- `src/common/hooks/useInboxFilters.ts` - Enhanced tag loading

### 2. Newsletter Click Not Marking as Read/Archived
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Problem**:
- Clicking newsletters in sources page wasn't marking them as read
- Newsletters weren't being archived when opened from inbox
- Actions were failing silently without error visibility

**Solution Applied**:
- Added comprehensive error handling to newsletter click handler
- Separated read and archive actions with individual error tracking
- Ensured navigation works even if other actions fail

**Files Changed**:
- `src/web/pages/Inbox.tsx` - Enhanced click handler with error handling

## How to Test

### Multi-Tag Filtering Test
1. Go to `/inbox?tags=tag1,tag2` in your browser
2. ✅ **Expected**: Only newsletters with BOTH tag1 AND tag2 should show
3. ✅ **Expected**: Tag pills should appear in the UI showing active filters
4. Click a tag in a newsletter row
5. ✅ **Expected**: URL updates and filtering applies immediately

### Newsletter Click Test
1. Find an unread, unarchived newsletter
2. Click on it to open detail view
3. ✅ **Expected**: Newsletter gets marked as read (if was unread)
4. ✅ **Expected**: Newsletter gets archived (if opened from inbox)
5. ✅ **Expected**: Detail page loads correctly
6. Check browser console for any error messages
